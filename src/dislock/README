:: Dislock ::

This is a very simple implementation of distributed lock on top of Redis.

It is just for fun.  :)

HOW TO TEST

1. Build this cake:

  $ git clone https://github.com/leandrosilva/go-learning
  $ cd go-learning/src/dislock/lock
  $ go install
  $ cd ../nuclear-test
  $ go install
  $ cd ../../../bin/    # "go-learning/bin"

2. Fire a Redis server:

  $ redis-server

3. Open one terminal and fire a nuclear-test:

  $ ./nuclear-test -u nuclear_blah -c mr_burns
  
4. Open other terminal and fire a nuclear-test:

  $ ./nuclear-test -u nuclear_blah -c homer_simpson

5. On terminal one, press <RETURN> key

6. Take a look at terminal two

7. Back to terminal one and try the step 3
